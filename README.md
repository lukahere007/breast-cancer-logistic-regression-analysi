🧬 Breast Cancer Malignancy Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project explores logistic regression modeling to predict breast cancer diagnosis (malignant vs benign) using tumor characteristics extracted from digitized fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
🔍 Key Highlights

    Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (n = 569)

    Goal: Build a predictive model using logistic regression

    Techniques:

        Exploratory data analysis with ggstatsplot

        Correlation and feature selection

        Model comparison using AIC, AUC, and validation accuracy

        Training-validation-test split (60%-20%-20%)

    Final Model: Based on texture_mean, concavity_mean, and radius_mean

    Performance:

        Validation AUC: 0.993

        Test Accuracy: 95.6%

        Test AUC: 0.974
